## Problem 1

To obtain a distribution for $\hat{r}^2$, we’ll follow basically the
same procedure we used for regression coefficients: draw bootstrap
samples; the a model to each; extract the value I’m concerned with; and
summarize. Here, we’ll use `modelr::bootstrap` to draw the samples and
`broom::glance` to produce `r.squared` values.

### Loading data

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

``` r
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::glance)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = r.squared)) + geom_density()
```

In this example, the $\hat{r}^2$ value is high, and the upper bound at 1
may be a cause for the generally skewed shape of the distribution. If we
wanted to construct a confidence interval for $R^2$, we could take the
2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the estimates across bootstrap samples.
However, because the shape isn’t symmetric, using the mean +/- 1.96
times the standard error probably wouldn’t work well.

We can produce a distribution for $\log(\beta_0 * \beta1)$ using a
similar approach, with a bit more wrangling before we make our plot.

``` r
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  select(id = `.id`, term, estimate) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = term, 
    values_from = estimate) %>% 
  rename(beta0 = `(Intercept)`, beta1 = tmin) %>% 
  mutate(log_b0b1 = log(beta0 * beta1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log_b0b1)) + geom_density()
```

As with $r^2$, this distribution is somewhat skewed and has some
outliers.

The point of this is not to say you should always use the bootstrap –
it’s possible to establish “large sample” distributions for strange
parameters / values / summaries in a lot of cases, and those are great
to have. But it is helpful to know that there’s a way to do inference
even in tough cases.

## Problem 2

Read in and clean data

``` r
homicide_df =
  read.csv("./data_WP/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ', ', state),
    resolved = case_when(
           disposition =="Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
           disposition =="Open/No arrest" ~ 0,
           disposition =="Closed by arrest" ~ 1
         )) %>% 
  subset(city_state!="Dallas, TX" & city_state!="Phoenix, AZ" & city_state!="Kansas City, MO" & city_state!="Tulsa, AL") %>%
  filter(victim_race == "White" | victim_race == "Black") %>%
  relocate(city_state)
```

``` r
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

baltimore_fit = 
  baltimore_df %>% 
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) 

baltimore_fit %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 4
    ##   term               log_OR    OR  p.value
    ##   <chr>               <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)       0.310   1.36  7.04e- 2
    ## 2 victim_age       -0.00673 0.993 4.30e- 2
    ## 3 victim_raceWhite  0.842   2.32  1.45e- 6
    ## 4 victim_sexMale   -0.854   0.426 6.26e-10
